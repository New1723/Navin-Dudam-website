            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Navin Dudam. I recently graduated from Nagesh Karajagi College of Engineering and Technology Solapur, affiliated with DBATU University, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering, achieving a cumulative CGPA of 7.91/9.5. Prior to this, I completed a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Swami Vivekanand Institute of Technology, Solapur, where I secured a percentage of 82%.

                Throughout my academic journey, I have built a solid foundation in CAD Modeling Software and Mechanical Design. My proficiency includes working with software like SolidWorks, AutoCAD, and Catia. I am also skilled in programming languages such as C , Core Java & HTML.
                
                My education has been enriched by hands-on experience through various university projects. Notably, I have developed a Q450 quad-copter drone, gaining comprehensive knowledge of electronic components including motors, controllers, GPS systems, and transmitters. Additionally, I conceptualized and meticulously designed a hexacopter drone using SolidWorks, which has versatile applications such as precision spraying in agriculture and efficient cleaning of solar panels. This project not only honed my design skills but also showcased my adeptness in project management as I played a pivotal role as both a designer and accountant.
                
                Currently, I am interning as an NPD & Design Engineer at Lei India Pvt Ltd in Pune. My responsibilities include creating 2D & 3D drawings for sensor actuators and Ethernet connectors. I am proficient in comprehensive documentation including DFMEA, PPAP, APQP, and I work with cross-functional teams to add valuable inputs in new product development to meet customer requirements.
                
                In addition to my academic and internship experiences, I have earned certifications such as the CSWA Certification in Mechanical Design from Dassault System and an NPTEL Certification in 'C Programming'. I actively participated in national-level competitions, demonstrating creativity, innovation, teamwork, collaboration, networking, and an entrepreneurial mindset.
                
                My ambition is to continually develop my skills and knowledge, contributing to innovative projects and making a significant impact in the field of mechanical engineering.</p>
